# Crit+ Mod
This is a mod to significantly boost the effect of crit items in the game, and allow crit stacking to result in 'red crits', which is when crit chance is applied multiple times.

## Changes
-Lens-Maker glasses now increase the critical strike multiplier by .5 each
-All items that interact with crit chance (such as the Predatory Instinct and the Harvester Scythe) now give 5% crit chance for EACH, instead of only gaining 5% on the first one.
-Ocular HUD now doubles your crit multiplier for the duration.
-Red Crit System

##Red Crits
In most games, once you hit 100% crit chance, there's literally no point in building any more. But in a few rare cases, exceeding 100% is not only possible, but brings great rewards, as it allows attacks to crit multiple times.
Let me explain:
	See, with Red Crits, with 125% crit chance, not only will you have a 100% chance to double your damage, but an additional 25% chance for it to double again, for x4 damage. If your crit multiplier is increased as well, then this goes even higher.
A Red Crit system has no upper limit, so feel free to build as much crit as you like, and watch as enemies loose thousands of health to each attack.
